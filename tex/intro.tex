\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

{\em Introductions are among the most difficult to write.  A
  well-written intro will put a reader in the right frame of mind.
  Most reviewers have already decided to accept or reject the paper by
  the time they finish the intro, so it's critical to plan and execute
  this part well.  Great papers are like great novels; they have plots
  and draw the reader in.  But unlike novels, papers have to spill the
  beans very early -- ideally in the first paragraph of the intro in a
  very direct manner that states the claim and provides just enough in
  the way of tantalizing details that the reader wants to know more.
  How did they do it?  Does is really work?  How did they address all
  those corner cases?  If all goes well, you want the reader thinking
  to themselves, `Wow, this is really clever.  I wish I'd thought of
  it.'}
