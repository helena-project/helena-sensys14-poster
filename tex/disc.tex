\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:disc}

{\em This section is mostly there to tie up loose ends and admit `mea
  culpas' that you know you're going to get hammered on otherwise.
  It's alright to have flaws and limitation but it's important to
  address them honestly and directly, without appearing like you're
  trying to squirm out of something.  You've got to be brutally honest
  here.}
