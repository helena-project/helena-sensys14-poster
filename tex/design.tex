\section{Design}

{\em This is the section where the ``conceptual'' design of the system
  is presented.  Note that this is different from the actual
  implementation details, which are described later.}

% An approximation of the sections from the powercube wisdom:
{\em Begin by describing the basic idea, then bring up issues with the basic
solution and show design points that solve them. By the end you should have
argued for your entire design and design choices.}
