% ABSTRACT

% opening sentence may be a little much..
20~years ago, sensor networking birthed itself as a community by repurposing
components to achieve a capability for sensing and communicating previously
undreamed of. An explosion of research explored the hardware and software, the
sensing and interfacing, the communication and protocols that could possibly
make networks of small, embedded devices---motes---work.

Today, we are beyond the simple mission of making things work. As the greater
community has come to understand the value of networked embedded systems and
the contraints and requirements they impose, the landscape has shifted.
Hardware developers have heeded our call, building resource-conscious
processors that acheieve lower energy budgets with greater computing
capability. Wireless developers have heeded our call, creating protocols that
support quick and cheap setup and teardown from discovery through
authenticated communication. Software has heeded the call, developing tools
and operating systems optimized for resource-constrained devices.

In this poster, we look towards tomorrow. We seek to understand how to more
effectively use the new hardware and communication tools available. We aim to
identify the new abstractions and faculties that will further empower the next
generation of embedded software design. We look to integrate this knowledge to
identify the key advances that will usher in the post-mote era.
