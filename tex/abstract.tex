% ABSTRACT

For the last fifteen years, an explosion of research explored the hardware and
software, the sensing and interfacing, the communication and protocols that
could possibly make networks of small, embedded devices---motes---work,
sometimes just barely.

Today, we are beyond the simple mission of making things work. As society
has come to realize the value of networked embedded systems, and
the contraints and requirements they impose, the landscape has shifted.
Hardware developers have heeded the call, building resource-conscious
processors that acheieve lower energy budgets with greater computing
capability. Wireless developers have heeded the call, creating protocols that
support rapid and efficient setup and teardown from discovery through
authenticated communication. Software has heeded the call, developing tools
and operating systems optimized for resource-constrained devices.

In this poster, we argue the time has come to look beyond optimizing networks
of motes. We look towards new technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy and
capable energy harvesting, with new application spaces such as the personal
area networks, and new capabilities and requirements in security and privacy
to inform the hardware and software platforms of the post-mote era.
