\section{A New Platform, Hardware and Software}

The next generation mote will reflect the diversity and flexibility that comes
with a more mature field. Its processor will be more capable with more memory,
yet at an equal or lower power budget. Its radio will be more flexible,
incorporating basic SDR-like features and exposing more control over link and
MAC operation. While wired I/O has not changed much yet in recent years,
next-next generation hardware anticipates a need for a new
interconnect~\cite{kuo14mbus}, and looking forward towards these kind of
interfaces will aide long-term viability.

Time and experience have identified fundamental concepts to re-think and
re-build for the next generation embedded operating
system~\cite{tinyos-retrospective}. Some key improvements we believe are
necessary to focus on are: i) improving the developer experience, potentially
incorporating non-traditional design tools to assist
programmers~\cite{brown-bubbles}, ii) adding advanced constructs like C\#'s
await that enables sequential reasoning in an event-driven model, iii) developing
better ``operating system''-like behavior, better isolating application
developers from resource contention and exposing interfaces that permit
higher-level application logic to be written in friendly, easier languages
(e.g. a syscall interface), iv) expanding the operating system (or libraries)
to provide more simple, less flexible, and more feature complete utilities
like networking, without sacrificing the research community's capability to
explore, and v) deepening community and industry
involvement, starting with building stronger ties and buy-in from people
already invested in the embedded ecosystem and then looking towards enabling
usability by true novices, much as Arduino and other upcoming platforms do
today.

% [as written, this misses some of the higher-level ideas from Phil’s e-mail;

% MPA: I think point iii can be expanded. We want to isolate the user from the
% complexities of writing ‘correct’ event-driven software, and having decent
% communication capabilities - which I think was one of the original goals of
% TinyOS - but we also now want to isolate users from the complexities of
% dealing with advancing hardware. Users enjoy Arduino because you don’t need to
% fiddle with registers to get things to work, if we can offer a level of
% abstraction such that users can make low-energy applications on
% high-performance systems, it would be great.

% --> I think I address this better now across iii and iv
% 
% *Pat: This is something I’ve been thinking about for a long time. It makes
% writing event-driven code much easier to reason about and I think it is
% possible to build into something like this into TinyOS / nesC and I think I
% know how to do it. I would love to sit down and chat with someone about this
% some time.
% 
% 
% people don’t want to build custom hw all the time; mote needs to be future
% proof. Work today even uses telosBs because they can and they’re available
% (well, ish, harder to buy now).
