\section{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

{\em Sometime it's useful to present an overview of the system, along
  with a figure that shows the major system components, to give the
  reader a roadmap of what's ahead.  Not all papers need this section,
  but it helps ground the subsequent discussion.}
